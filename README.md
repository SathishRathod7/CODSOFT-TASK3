Overview of the Project      

Project:  Sales Prediction Using Python      

Objective: Predict future sales volumes for a product or service based on historical data and various influencing factors. Use predictions to 
            allocate advertising budgets effectively across different platforms to maximize sales. Understand and segment the target audience 
             based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies. 

Key Activities:         
1. Dataset Selection: Choose a dataset relevant to the problem domain or area of interest.       
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values through imputation or removal,Correct data types if necessary,Remove duplicates and irrelevant 
   data      
3. Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features that could influence sales, such as seasonal trends, promotional events, 
   and pricing.         
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, trends, and correlations between variables.        
5. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for sales prediction. Common models include Linear Regression, Random 
   Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Time Series models.          
6. Model Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-square    
7. Prediction and Interpretation: Use the trained model to predict future sales and interpret the results to provide actionable 
   insights..     

Technologies Used:        
1.Python: Programming Language      
2.pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.      
3. numpy: for numerical operations and array handling.      
4. matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.      
5. seaborn: for statistical data visualization
